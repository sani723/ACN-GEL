# Button

Buttons are used to show the user’s choice of options for actions and assign these to a clear hierarchy. A button helps the user to find the most important actions of a page or within a viewport and enables them to perform these actions. The label is used to clearly indicate to the user what action will be triggered. Buttons allow users to commit a change, complete steps in a task, or make choices.

## Usage guidelines

The primary button is used for the most important action on a page or in a view. The transparent secondary button with a thin frame is used for subordinate actions. The text button is applied as a subtle call to action.

## Dos

- Button labels:
  - Must describe the action the button performs
  - Should include a verb
  - Concise, specific, self-explanatory labels
  - Always include a noun if there is any room for interpretation about what the verb operates on
- Place buttons in consistent locations in the user interface for best user experience
- Use aria status / alert elements when applying the loading state.

## Don’ts

- Button labels:
  - No use of generic labels like "Ok" especially in the case of an error, errors are never "Ok"
- Do not use a button for a text link or navigation item
- Do not use two primary buttons in a button group
- Do not use a primary button with a text button in a button group

## Use cases

- Key calls to action, such as "Request a quote" or "Reserve an e-tron."
- Supporting calls to action, such as "Learn more" or "Explore."
- Legal calls to action, such as "View key offer details."
- Alongside an input field, when there is an action to be taken after the user has inputted their information (e.g. searching for nearby dealers based on the user's location).
