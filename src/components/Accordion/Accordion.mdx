# Accordion

Accordions are used to expand and collapse content related to a given heading. It allows larger sections of information to be presented to the user in a more digestible format, with the heading providing the user with an indication of what content will be revealed when the accordion is expanded.

## Usage guidelines

Use an accordion to expand and collapse content related to a given heading.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <AccordionStories.Default />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Best practices

- Use an accordion to group together long sections of related content into a more digestible format.
- Use an accordion for information that can take a lower priority than other content on the page.
- Use an accordion to help reduce the length of a page, while still ensuring that all necessary information is available to users.
- Use the accordion heading to clearly communicate to users the content that will be available when the section is expanded.
- Do not use an accordion to hide calls to action that require the user's attention.
- Do not use an accordion to hide error states.
- Do not use an accordion as a selection control component for the user.
- Do not use an accordion to hide important legal or privacy information.

## Examples

import Accordion from "./Accordion";

const items = [
  {
    title: "Accordion Item 1",
    content: "Content for accordion item 1.",
  },
  {
    title: "Accordion Item 2",
    content: "Content for accordion item 2.",
  },
