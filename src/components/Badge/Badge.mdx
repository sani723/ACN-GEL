# Badge

Badges are labels that hold small amounts of information. They are used in conjunction with another component to draw attention to a change the user may want to review, such as a new message or cart item.

## Usage guidelines

Use the badge to represent unread notifications on the web app.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <BadgeStories.Default />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Best practices

- Use badges for counts of important information, in close proximity to the relevant item.
- Use badges to notify or draw attention to changed values or status.
- A small dot badge notifies the user that something is new or updated without showing a count, such as an "unread report", or activity notification. It may be useful as a less prominent badge, even when the count is known.
- Always maintain the same position in relation to the anchor element for the same usage of the badge.
