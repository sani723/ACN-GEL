## Best Practices

### Do

- Use Appropriate Tags: Use the appropriate HTML tag (p, h1, h2, etc.) for the context in which the label is used. For example, use h1 for the main heading of a page.
- Maintain Consistency: Use consistent font sizes, weights, and line heights as defined in the design tokens to maintain a uniform look and feel across the application.
- Readability: Ensure the text is easily readable by using appropriate text alignment, font size, and line height.
- Accessibility: Ensure the text is accessible by using semantic HTML tags and appropriate text transformations.

### Don't

- Overuse Styles: Avoid using too many different styles within the same component, as it can make the text hard to read and the interface cluttered.
- Ignore Accessibility: Do not ignore accessibility guidelines. Ensure that text transformations and decorations do not hinder readability for users with visual impairments.
- Hardcode Values: Avoid hardcoding font sizes, weights, and line heights. Instead, use the design tokens provided to ensure consistency.

## Examples

### Basic Label

```jsx
import Label from "./Label";

<Label
  text="Sample Text"
  tag="p"
  textAlign="left"
  textTransform="none"
  fontSize="md"
  fontWeight="regular"
  lineHeight="normal"
  textDecoration="none"

```
