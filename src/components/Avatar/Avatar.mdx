# Avatar

Avatar components are visual representations of a user or entity. They can contain either characters on a neutral background, or an image, typically set by the user.

Typically they will be used to represent an individual account holder or internal tool user.

## Usage guidelines

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <AvatarStories.Default />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Image

Where possible, allow a user to include an image with their avatar to give the user the impression of personalized content even more. Images passed to the component are cropped into a circle.

### Text

Text avatars should be used when there is no image available for the user, or as a fallback when the user defined image fails to display. The font size is set to allow a maximum of 2 characters of Latin script at the small size.

### Icon

Alternative solution to the initials. Only the icon “user ” will be used for the component.

### Sizes

#### Small

The smallest size is intended to be used in headers or when there may be multiple avatars in close proximity, such as a list of users.

#### Medium

Medium size should be used on sidebars, or elsewhere when the avatar takes up a more prominent position than in the header.

#### Large

The largest size is intended primarily for use on profile pages, where a user may want to review the photo they have, and where it takes a prominent position on the page. Often this can be combined with an edit button close by.

## Best practices

- Always include a user's initials when available.
- Where possible, make the avatar selectable and take the user to a profile page if applicable.
- The number of user initials displayed is left up to the implementer, ensure consistency across all instances where you use the components.
- If using in conjunction with badges, ensure consistency in placement for each use case (e.g. presence indicator / notifications).
